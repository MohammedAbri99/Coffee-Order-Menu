# Coffee-Order-Menu

### First Edition :

######Problem Statement:  
You've been tasked with creating a basic C# program for a coffee shop that  
helps customers place and manage their orders. The program should run in  
the console and provide a simple interface for users to choose their coffee  
options, customize their orders, and view the total cost.  

so in this edition i solved the problem by the esentioal difinition of language c sharp.  


### Second Edition:

Extend the previous coffee shop program by implementing functions to modularize the code and enhance its readability and maintainability. Your program should now consist of the following functions:
- display_menu(): Display the coffee menu with options and prices.
  
- place_order(): Allow customers to select their desired coffee and specify any customizations (e.g., size, sugar, milk). Return the selected coffee and customization details.

- calculate_cost(selected_coffee, size): Calculate and return the total cost of the order based on the selected coffee and customizations. Each Size will have a different price.

- display_order_summary(selected_coffee, size, sugar, milk, total_cost): Display a summary of the items, customizations, and the total cost.

- main(): The main function should handle the overall flow of the program, integrating the above functions. It should allow customers to place orders, view order summaries, and exit the program gracefully.

  in this edition i useed some advance tobics like enum and function.
